My method for creating new datasets 
---
NOTE: Using a text editor like Notepad++ is an alternate simpler option by using Find and Replace 
in order to format the dataset in [[Number,Letter],[1,A],[2,B],[3,C],...[26,Z]]; format

1. Save dataset as CSV
2. Start Python IDLE GUI
3. Import OS and CSV with "import csv" and "import os"
4. Use chdir to set Python to the folder with your dataset "chdir('C:/Downloads/snap/bags/data')"
5. Use the statement "print(list(csv.reader(open(r'FILENAME' ))))" with filename as your csv
7. Copy and paste results into the end of bags_datasets.js
8. In bags_objects, add a new block in SpriteMorph.prototype.initBlocks() with a similar template as other blocks on Line 21
9. In bags_objects, add a statement 'blocks(push('NEW_BLOCK'))' where similar calls are made on Line 352
